Auto Price Prediction
Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning
1. Introduction

The automotive market is vast and dynamic, and accurate price estimation plays a crucial role for buyers, sellers, and dealerships. Manual valuation is often time-consuming and inconsistent. This project aims to predict the selling price of cars automatically based on features like brand, year, mileage, and other specifications. Using machine learning algorithms, we can make fast, reliable, and data-driven predictions that assist in decision-making.

2. Objectives

Build machine learning models to predict car prices based on given features.

Compare multiple regression algorithms to find the best-performing model.

Evaluate performance using R² Score and RMSE.

Create a deployable prediction system for web or desktop use.

3. Dataset Description

Source: Provided dataset (as per project PDF)

Type: Structured CSV file with numeric and categorical features

Features (examples):

Car Brand / Model

Year of Manufacture

Mileage (km driven)

Fuel Type

Transmission Type

Engine Size / Power

Number of Owners

Target Variable: Selling Price (in local currency)

Train/Test Split: 80% training, 20% testing

4. Methodology
4.1 Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values.

Encoding categorical variables (One-Hot Encoding / Label Encoding).

Scaling numerical features.

Train/test splitting.

4.2 Model Selection

Tested the following algorithms:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

4.3 Model Evaluation Metrics

R² Score – measures how well the predictions fit the actual data.

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) – measures prediction error in the same units as the price.

4.4 Training Details

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn

5. Results
Model	R² Score	RMSE
Linear Regression	0.8535	4233.72
Random Forest	0.9332	2858.50
XGBoost	0.9422	2659.57

Best Model: ✅ XGBoost – highest R², lowest RMSE

6. Challenges Faced

Variations in data quality.

Presence of outliers affecting model accuracy.

Feature correlation leading to multicollinearity.

7. Solutions Implemented

Applied feature engineering to create meaningful variables.

Removed or capped extreme outliers.

Performed hyperparameter tuning for tree-based models.

8. Future Improvements

Integrate deep learning models for complex feature interactions.

Expand dataset to include more brands and newer models.

Deploy as a web application with real-time input forms.

9. Conclusion

The project successfully built a machine learning pipeline for car price prediction. Among the tested algorithms, XGBoost performed the best, achieving an R² score of 0.94 and RMSE of ~2660. The results show strong potential for use in automotive marketplaces and dealership pricing tools.
